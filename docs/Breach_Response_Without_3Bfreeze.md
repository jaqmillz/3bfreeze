While we are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of any information involved in this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident and steps you can take to protect yourself, should you feel it necessary.

**What Happened?** On January 6, 2025, we discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain systems within our network. We immediately secured our systems and initiated an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic experts. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party had access to our environment from November 12, 2024, to January 6, 2025, and obtained some files associated with current and former patients. Given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Summit has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein. We are providing you with this notice upon the recent conclusion of this time-intensive data analysis as your personal information was contained in the affected files.

**What Information Was Involved.** The affected files contained your name and the following: Social Security number, date of birth, address, and health insurance information. Presently, we have no evidence or indication of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information.

**What We Are Doing.** Upon discovery of the incident, we safely restored our systems and operations and notified law enforcement. We are also notifying you in case you decide to take further steps to protect your information should you feel it appropriate to do so. In addition, we are providing you with access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Epiq at no charge to you. You must enroll by June 30, 2025.

**What You Can Do.** Please review the enclosed "Steps You Can Take to Help Protect Your Information" which describes the services we are offering, how to activate them, and provides further details on how to protect yourself. We encourage you to remain vigilant against the potential for identity theft and fraud and to monitor your credit reports for any suspicious activity.

### Obtain a Free Credit Report

Under U.S. law, you are entitled to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Ordering a copy of your credit report from each agency on an annual basis, and reviewing it for suspicious activity, can help you spot problems and address them quickly. You can request your free credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com or by phone at 1-877-322-8228. You can also request your free credit report by completing the request form at: www.annualcreditreport.com, and mailing it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You may wish to stagger your requests so that you receive a free report by one of the three credit bureaus every four months.

### Place a Fraud Alert

As a precaution against identity theft, you can consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A "fraud alert" tells creditors to contact you before opening a new account or changing an existing account. A fraud alert also lets your creditors know to watch for unusual or suspicious activity. To place a fraud alert, call any one of the three major credit reporting agencies listed below. An initial fraud alert remains effective for ninety days and is free of charge. If you wish, you can renew the fraud alert at the expiration of this initial period. As soon as one credit agency confirms your fraud alert, the others are notified to place fraud alerts on your file.

**Experian** — 1-888-397-3742 — P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013-9701 — experian.com/fraud/center.html

**TransUnion** — 1-800-680-7289 — P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016-1000 — transunion.com/fraud-alerts

### Place a Security Freeze

Federal law also allows consumers to place, lift or remove a security freeze on their credit reports at no charge. A security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer's credit report without written authorization. Be aware that placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prevent the timely approval of any requests you make for new loans, credit, mortgages, employment, housing, or other services.

To place a security freeze on your credit report, you must send a written request by regular, certified, or overnight mail to *each* of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax (www.equifax.com); Experian (www.experian.com); and TransUnion (www.transunion.com). You may also request the security freeze through *each of* the credit reporting agencies' websites or over the phone:

**Equifax** — 1-888-298-0045 — P.O. Box 105788, Atlanta, GA 30348-5788 — equifax.com/personal/help/place-lift-remove-security-freeze/

**Experian** — 1-888-397-3742 — P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013 — experian.com/freeze/center.html

**TransUnion** — 1-888-909-8872 — P.O. Box 160, Woodlyn, PA 19094 — transunion.com/credit-freeze

In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:

1. Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.);
2. Social Security Number;
3. Date of birth;
4. If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years;
5. Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill;
6. A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.); and
7. If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.

The credit reporting agencies have three (3) business days after receiving your request to place a security freeze on your credit report. The credit bureaus must also send written confirmation to you within five (5) business days and provide you with a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password, or both that can be used by you to authorize the removal or lifting of the security freeze.

### Additional Information

You may obtain additional information about identity theft (including a security freeze) by contacting the above, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or your state Attorney General. The Federal Trade Commission can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY: 1-866-653-4261.
