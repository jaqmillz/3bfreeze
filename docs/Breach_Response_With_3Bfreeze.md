**Re: Notice of Data Incident**

Dear John Smith:

We are writing to inform you about a recent security incident at Summit Health Partners ("Summit") that may have involved some of your personal information. Summit provides healthcare services, including primary care, specialty medicine, and urgent care across the southeastern United States. While we are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of any information involved in this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident and steps you can take to protect yourself, should you feel it necessary.

**What Happened?** On January 6, 2025, we discovered that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain systems within our network. We immediately secured our systems and initiated an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic experts. Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party had access to our environment from November 12, 2024, to January 6, 2025, and obtained some files associated with current and former patients. Given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Summit has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein. We are providing you with this notice upon the recent conclusion of this time-intensive data analysis as your personal information was contained in the affected files.

**What Information Was Involved.** The affected files contained your name and the following: Social Security number, date of birth, address, and health insurance information. Presently, we have no evidence or indication of actual or attempted misuse of your personal information.

**What We Are Doing.** Upon discovery of the incident, we safely restored our systems and operations and notified law enforcement. We are also notifying you in case you decide to take further steps to protect your information should you feel it appropriate to do so. In addition, we are providing you with access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Epiq at no charge to you. You must enroll by June 30, 2025.

**What You Can Do.** We sincerely regret any issue this incident may have caused you. If you have additional questions, you may call our dedicated assistance line at 855-901-3344 (toll-free), Monday-Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, or write to us at Attn: Data Incident, 200 South Tryon Street, Suite 1400, Charlotte, NC 28202.
